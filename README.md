# EEG Classification Repository
The goal of the project is to compare the performance of various algorithms on EEG signals classification task. 
## Repository Structure
The repository has the following structure:

main.py: The main script for running the EEG classification pipeline.
hyper_tuning/: This folder contains optimizers for tuning the model parameters.
preproces/: This folder contains scripts for preprocessing the EEG data, including filtering, standardization/normalization (min-max scaling), data import, and merging into a single dataset.
models/: This folder contains pre-trained models for EEG classification. The available models include dense neural networks, convolutional neural networks, LSTM networks, EEGNet, and SVMs.
